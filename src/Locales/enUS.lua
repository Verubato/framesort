Adjusts the position of each individual frame and doesn't bug/lock/taint the UI.
\n
Pros:
 - Can sort frames from other addons.
 - Can apply frame spacing.
 - No taint (technical term for addons interfering with Blizzard's UI code).
\n
Cons:
 - Fragile house of cards situation to workaround Blizzard spaghetti.
 - May break with WoW patches and cause the developer to go insane.

L["Traditional"] = nil
L["SortingMethod_Traditional_Description"] = [[
This is the standard sorting mode that addons and macros have used for 10+ years.
It replaces the internal Blizzard sorting method with our own.
This is the same as the 'SetFlowSortFunction' script but with FrameSort configuration.
\n
Pros:
 - More stable/reliable as it leverages Blizzard's internal sorting methods.
\n
Cons:
 - Only sorts Blizzard party frames, nothing else.
 - Will cause Lua errors which is normal and can be ignored.
 - Cannot apply frame spacing.

You can find the FrameSort keybindings in the standard WoW keybindings area.
\n
What are the keybindings useful for?
They are useful for targeting players by their visually ordered representation rather than their
party position (party1/2/3/etc.)
\n
For example, imagine a 5-man dungeon group sorted by role that looks like the following:
  - Tank, party3
  - Healer, player
  - DPS, party1
  - DPS, party4
  - DPS, party2
\n
As you can see their visual representation differs to their actual party position which
makes targeting confusing.
If you were to /target party1, it would target the DPS player in position 3 rather than the tank.
\n
FrameSort keybindings will target based on their visual frame position rather than party number.
So targeting 'Frame 1' will target the Tank, 'Frame 2' the healer, 'Frame 3' the DPS in spot 3, and so on.
