# Frame Sort #

A simple World of Warcraft (Retail) add-on that places the player frame (you) at the top/middle/bottom (configurable) of the party/raid frames.

## Features ##

* Place the player frame at the top, middle, or bottom.
* Works for both raid-style party and regular raid frames.
* Sort the remaining frames by group/role/alphabetical.
* Setup different sorting rules for arena, bgs, world, and raids.
* Taintless sorting method to avoid taint/UI issues.
* Set keybindings to target frames based on their visually ordered representation rather than their party number.
* Add spacing between frames.
* Macro support for @frame targeting.
* Supports both Retail and Wotlk.
